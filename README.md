# Sunya: 3D Equation Visualization

**Sunya** is a high-performance application designed for visualizing mathematical equations in 3D. The project integrates advanced image processing, machine learning, and GPU-accelerated rendering technologies.

## **Features**

- **Image Processing**: Detect and process handwritten equations using OpenCV and Tesseract OCR.
- **Machine Learning**: Improve recognition accuracy with TensorFlow, accelerated by CUDA.
- **3D Rendering**: Render equations in 3D using Vulkan and GLM.
- **Geometric Computation**: Utilize CGAL and OpenMesh for meshing and geometric algorithms.
- **Browser-Based UI**: Run the UI in the browser with Emscripten, Qt for WebAssembly, Three.js, and React.
- **Backend Frameworks**: Boost.Beast or uWebSockets for WebSocket communication, gRPC for RPC, and C++ REST SDK for RESTful services.
- **Cross-Platform GPU Support**: CUDA, HIP, ROCm, Intel oneAPI, and OpenCL.
- **Optimization and Profiling**: Tools like NVIDIA Nsight, AMD ROCm Profiler, Intel VTune Profiler, gperftools, and RenderDoc for performance tuning.
